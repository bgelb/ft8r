"""WSJT-X compatible FT8 CRC-14 mapping.

This table encodes the linear mapping from the 77 message bits plus a
constant term to the 14 CRC bits as produced by WSJT-X (ft8code).

Each row lists the indices in the augmented input vector that XOR to 1 for
that output bit. Indices 0..76 refer to the 77 message bits; index 77 refers
to a constant 1 term.

The mapping was derived empirically by solving Y = X * B over GF(2) using
ft8code as the oracle for diverse standard messages. It eliminates any
ambiguity about bit ordering and matches WSJT-X exactly.
